# Python Forest from Scratch

This project consist on implementing common tree and forest algorithms in plain Python from scratch. This has two goals:

* Emulate the Sklearn implementation on the tree and forests.

* Add new algorithms and metrics to research and test new implementations.

####TODO

* Implement gini criterion.

* Create DecisionTreeRegressor.

* Plot_tree.

* Develop S0(2) transformation before splits.
