# Python Forest from Scratch

This project consist on implementing common tree and forest algorithms in plain Python from scratch. This has two goals:

* Emulate the Sklearn Tree and Forests using pure Python (instead of Cython).

* Add new algorithms and metrics to research and test new implementations.

#### Dependencies

- Python>=3.6
- Numpy==1.18.1
- SciPy==1.4.1

#### Bonsai. Lite Tree implementation

Bonsais are just a naming for some lite implementation of the tree algorithms which its interface and structure try to mimic the [Scikit-Learn tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) implementation.

#### Todo

* Create DecisionTreeRegressor.

* Plot_tree.

* Develop Non-max-supression.

#### Contact and Help

Any help, consideration, opinion or suggestion is welcome. Do not doubt to write me!
